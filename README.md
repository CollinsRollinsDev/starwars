### Stack Used
* ReactJs

### Short Description
Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by 
George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly 
became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon.

This is a small React application that lists the names of 
Star Wars movies in a dropdown and the opening crawl of the selected movie 
below the selection along with a list of the characters that appear in that 
movie

### Features of the app
* The user interface is having a basic theme of black and yellow.
* Movie names in the dropdown are sorted by release date from 
  earliest to newest
* There should be no movie selected initially and the app should show 
  the Star Wars logo instead of movie information.
* The opening crawl of the selected movie is animated.
*  All characters that appear in that movie are listed showing name, 
gender, and height in the form of a table.
*  Character list can be sorted by clicking on the table headers.
*   Clicking on the same header twice toggles the sort order by the field 
between ascending and descending.
*  There is also be a gender filter selection right above the list so that 
either all characters are listed or only the selected gender are listed.
*  The last row of the table will show the total number of
characters currently visible on the list.
*  The last row will also show the sum of the heights of the characters
currently visible
*  Loading indicators should be shown in proper places while fetching 
data
*  Error messages should be shown if there are any errors
